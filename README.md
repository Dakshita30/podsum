# podsum
🎙️ Pod-Sum is an AI-powered audio summarization tool that converts spoken content into concise, readable PDF summaries. Leveraging Whisper for ASR, BART for abstractive summarization, and ReportLab for clean PDF generation, Pod-Sum makes podcast digests a breeze.
📚 This project was developed during our summer internship of 1st year at DTU by Dakshita Sandal and Bhumika Jangir.
